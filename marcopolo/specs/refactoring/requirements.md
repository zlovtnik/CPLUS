# Code Refactoring Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive refactoring effort to improve the ETL Plus system's code quality, maintainability, and architectural soundness. The refactoring addresses identified technical debt, code smells, and architectural anti-patterns while preserving existing functionality.

## Business Justification

### Current Pain Points

- **High Maintenance Cost**: Complex, tightly-coupled components increase development time
- **Bug Risk**: Large classes and methods increase the likelihood of introducing bugs
- **Developer Productivity**: Complex codebase slows down feature development
- **Technical Debt**: Accumulated architectural issues impact system scalability

### Expected Benefits

- **Reduced Maintenance Cost**: 30-40% reduction in time spent on bug fixes and feature additions
- **Improved Code Quality**: Better test coverage and fewer code smells
- **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Faster onboarding and easier feature development
- **Better System Reliability**: Reduced coupling leads to more stable system

- Methods average < 30 lines each
- No duplicated validation logic
- All API tests pass unchanged

### Requirement 4: Concurrency Pattern Standardization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent and safe concurrency patterns throughout the codebase, so that I can avoid threading bugs and deadlocks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN standardizing lock patterns THEN the system SHALL:
   - Use consistent lock types across similar use cases
   - Implement RAII lock helpers for common patterns
   - Document locking strategies for each component

2. WHEN improving lock management THEN the system SHALL:
   - Minimize lock scope and duration
   - Avoid nested locking where possible
   - Implement timeout mechanisms for critical locks

3. WHEN updating concurrency code THEN the system SHALL:
   - Replace raw mutex usage with scoped lock helpers
   - Standardize on std::scoped_lock for multiple mutex scenarios
   - Add lock ordering documentation to prevent deadlocks

4. IF concurrency patterns change THEN the system SHALL pass stress testing with 100+ concurrent operations

#### Definition of Done
- Consistent lock patterns across all components
- RAII lock helpers implemented and used
- Lock timeout mechanisms in place
- Deadlock prevention measures documented
- Stress tests pass with 100+ concurrent operations

### Requirement 5: WebSocket Manager Decoupling

**User Story:** As a developer, I want loosely coupled WebSocket components with clear interfaces, so that I can modify connection management without affecting message broadcasting logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN decoupling WebSocket components THEN the system SHALL separate:
   - Connection pool management
   - Message broadcasting logic
   - Connection lifecycle handling

2. WHEN creating component interfaces THEN the system SHALL:
   - Define clear contracts between components
   - Minimize dependencies between modules
   - Enable independent testing of each component
