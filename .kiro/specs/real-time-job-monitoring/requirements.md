# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds real-time job status monitoring capabilities to the ETL Plus system, allowing users to track the progress and status of running ETL jobs through WebSocket connections and enhanced REST API endpoints. The system will provide live updates on job execution, progress tracking, and detailed status information to improve operational visibility and user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an ETL operator, I want to monitor job execution in real-time, so that I can quickly identify issues and track progress without constantly polling the API.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a job starts execution THEN the system SHALL broadcast a job status update via WebSocket to all connected clients
2. WHEN a job progress changes THEN the system SHALL send progress updates with percentage completion and current step information
3. WHEN a job completes or fails THEN the system SHALL immediately notify all connected clients with final status and execution summary
4. WHEN a client connects to the WebSocket endpoint THEN the system SHALL send current status of all active jobs

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to view detailed job execution logs in real-time, so that I can troubleshoot issues as they occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a job generates log entries THEN the system SHALL stream log messages to connected WebSocket clients in real-time
2. WHEN log filtering is applied THEN the system SHALL only send log entries matching the specified log level or job ID
3. IF a client requests historical logs THEN the system SHALL provide access to stored log entries for completed jobs
4. WHEN log storage reaches capacity limits THEN the system SHALL implement log rotation with configurable retention policies

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the ETL system, I want enhanced REST API endpoints for job monitoring, so that I can build custom monitoring dashboards and integrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting job status via REST API THEN the system SHALL return detailed job information including progress, current step, and execution metrics
2. WHEN querying multiple jobs THEN the system SHALL support filtering by status, date range, and job type
3. WHEN requesting job metrics THEN the system SHALL provide execution time, data processed, error counts, and resource usage statistics
4. IF a job is not found THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP 404 status with descriptive error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an ETL operator, I want to receive notifications for critical job events, so that I can respond quickly to failures or important status changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a job fails THEN the system SHALL send high-priority notifications with error details and suggested actions
2. WHEN a job exceeds expected execution time THEN the system SHALL send warning notifications about potential performance issues
3. WHEN system resources are running low during job execution THEN the system SHALL alert operators about resource constraints
4. IF notification delivery fails THEN the system SHALL retry notification delivery with exponential backoff up to 3 attempts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure monitoring settings and thresholds, so that I can customize the monitoring behavior for different environments and requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring monitoring settings THEN the system SHALL allow customization of update frequencies, log levels, and notification thresholds
2. WHEN setting job timeout thresholds THEN the system SHALL validate configuration values and apply them to job monitoring
3. WHEN enabling or disabling monitoring features THEN the system SHALL apply changes without requiring system restart
4. IF invalid configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL reject the configuration with detailed validation error messages
